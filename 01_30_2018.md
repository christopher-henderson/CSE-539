# Birthday attack

## Birthday Paradox
	- If there are n numbers
		- 1.2*sqrt(n)
		> 50%

# Generate a Collision
We have two files, f1 and f2.
Want to make f1 and f2 have the same hash.

F1 concat NONCE
	- Increment nonce.
	- Generates f11, f12, f13...
	- Do this enough times you will find a collision.
	- Chance of success is L
		- 1.2 * sqrt(2^n)
		- Yup, birthday attack.
F2 concat NONCE
	- Increment nonce.
	- Generates f21, f22, f23...

N-bit hashes have a bit strength of n/2
Use larger sized hash function > SHA 256

# Secret Communication Over a Public Channel

INTRODUCING ALICE ANB BOB!!!!!!!!!!! Let's talk about the key exchange problem.

- The first known key exchange algorithm was the Diffie Helman key exchange.
	- Diffie claims he the idea from someone else. Interesting.

## Merkle's Puzzles
Two people agree on a secret, without anything being secret.

	- Hard to solve, but easy to verify. Such as sudoku.
	- Algorithm
		- Encrypt x to produce y, with key k
		- Given x and y, find k
		- Verify, given x, y, k easy to verify.
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%27s_Puzzles

## Problems with Merkle's Puzzle.
	1. Linear time to brute force, where n is the size of the puzzle set.
	2. No authentication.

# Diffie Helman Key Exchange (1967)
	- Alice and Bob agree on 2 numbers, n and g.
		- n --> large prime number
		- g --> generator (<n)
		- They screamed from the treetops, everyone can hear them.
	- Alice picks x (a secret)
	- Bob picks y (a secret)
	- Alice tells Bob (g^x) mod n
	- Bob tells Alice (g^y) mod n
	- Alice computes (g^y)^n = g^(ny) mod n
	- Alice computes (g^x)^y = g^(xy) mod n

## Generator (aka primitive root)
	For all k between 1 and n - 1
	there exists an i such that g^2 = k mod 2

## How to find/choose a g & n?
	- Use a known pair!
	- <g, n> publick keys
	- <x, y> private keys
	- g^(xy) --> secret key

## Authentication
