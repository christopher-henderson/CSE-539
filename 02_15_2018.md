# Resend Attack
	- Alice sends a message to Bob, encrypted by Bob's public key.
	- Mallory records it.
	- Mallory sends a message to Bob, Mallory's own message concatenated with the message Alice sent to Bob.
	- Bob decrypts this and echoes it to Mallory, signed by Bob's is private key (don't ask why, some systems do this).
	- Mallory decrypts it using Bob's public key.
	- Mallory now has the message Alice sent to Bob.

# MITM
	A --> M --> B
	A <-- M <-- B

## Interlock Protocol
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlock_protocol
	- Method of detecting MITM
	- Alice encrypts in receivers pub key, but sends only 1/2 of the bits/
	- Receiver does the same
	- Alice sents next 1/2, receiver does the same.

# Digital Signaturess
	- Authentic, unforgable, not reusable, not alterable, not reproducable
	- Signature = Epriv(hash(document))

# Digital Certificates
	Bob (I.E. their name)
	Bob's Pubkey
	Hash
	Signature of CA
