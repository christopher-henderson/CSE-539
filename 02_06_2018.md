# Crypto Protocols
	- A set of steps
	- For a goal
	- built out of basic crypto algorithms
		- Random #, hash, encryption

## Goals
	 - Privacy
	 - Integrity (message authentication)
	 - Authentication
	 - Non Repudiation
	 - Access Control

## Approach
	- Arbitrated
		- Needs a trusted third party (hello CAs)
	- Adjudiciated
		- Judging after the fact
		- Just do things, if someone complains, then adjudicate.
		- Normal in human society, right?
	- Self Enforcing
		- No third party. Idyllic.

## Authentication
	- What you know (password)
	- What you have (biometrics)
	- What you can do (speak?)

## Some Methods
	- Shared Secret --> Passwords
	- Challenge Response (SSH login)
	- Time based --> One time token (the key to this is a shared secret)
