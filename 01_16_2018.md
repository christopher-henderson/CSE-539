# Entropy

- Again, open algorithms. No Secrecy, no obscurity. The secret is _only_ in the key, where the key is an N bit number.

## Some base techniques
	- Shift
	- Permutation
	- Substitution
	- Expansion Permutation
	
	The goal is *_confusion and diffusion_* by cascading these functions.

## Old Ciphers
### Vigenere Cipher
	- Tabular
	- The key letter is the row, the plaintext letter is the column, result in the ciphertext letter.

### Affine Ciphers
	- y = (ax + b) % n
	- (a, b) -> key
	- n -> plaintext
	- y -> ciphertext

### One Time Pad
	- Key is the length of the plaintext.

## Substitution - Permutation Networks
	- https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution-permutation_network
	- Used in algorithms such as AES.

## Feistel network
	- https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_cipher
	- Builds a Feistel cipher, such as DES

## Block Cipher vs Stream Cipher
	- Block work on blocks of N bits at a time.
	- Stream cipher works on one bit at a time.

## Monoalphabetic Cipher
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher
	- All Block Ciphers
	- Since all block ciphers are all monoalphabetic, we would want some way to convert them to polyalphabetic.
	- MODES. YOU WILL FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE GOD DAMNED MODES MEAN.
		- They make the block cipher contextual upon itself, E.G. a block being XORed with the result of the previous.
