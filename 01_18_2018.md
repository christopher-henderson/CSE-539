Oldes Standard Encryption Algorithm

DES --> Digital Encryption Standard

1970, NIST Competition, winner was Lucifer from IBM. Became DES.
Some mysterious things were added to DES that made it stronger. However, this caused controversy because people tin foil hatted over this change.

# DES
65 bits feistel cipher (really 56 bit, 7 bits + 1 bit per byte for parity)

# Attacks
EFF Cracker (1998) - Custom Hardware
64 core machine, brute force it in 4 days
FPGA based, brute force it in 1 day

Closed Cipher
 - A cipher is closed if
 	- You encrypt using N number of keys and
 	- There is some other key that can perform the same work as those N keys.

 Triple DES
 	Encrypt --> Decrypt with some other wrong key --> Encrypt

DES - 56 bits
3DES - 116 bits
AES - 128/256/512 bits
RSA - 
	- ~~1024~~ --> 80 bits
	- ~~2084~~ --> 112 bits

# AES
Advanced Encryption Standard

- Competition --> Accepted in 2001 after five years of testing.
- Is a Rijndael Cipher --> invented by Jon Daemen, Vincent Rijmen
- Faster than 3DES
- Intel has built in AES instructions. These four instructions are an entire round in AES.
	- ADDROUNDKEY
	- SUBBYTES
	- SHIFTROWS
	- MIXCOLUMNS

# Random Numbers
Real --> from the real world
Psuedo --> Computed # from a seed (also called a nonce)
