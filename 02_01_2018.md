# Diffie Helman Continued

## Modulus (n)
	- The modulus must be prime.
	- If it is not prime, then it is a composite of primes.
	- Think back to the discrete log problem over a finite field.
		- g^x = k 
		- given g and k, find x
		- It is exponential in the number of bits in the modulus.
		- We don't know if the discrete log problem is hard.
	- Diffie Helman works only if you agree that the discrete log problem is hard.

	- If it is not prime, then the problem can be decomposed into two smaller problems (that is, what its factors).
		- Chinese Remainder Theorem
		- Polig - Helman Algorithm

- Authentication is still hard.
	- MITM attack are easy.


# Public Key Algorithms (Asymmetric Encyrption)

## RSA
	- Choose p, q --> large prime numbers
	- Compute n = p * q --> modulus
	- Compute phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
	- Choose e that is relatively prime to phi(n) (not what is sounds like, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RelativelyPrime.html)
	- e = 3, 5 .... may work (usuall 65537) (exponent)
	- Public key = exponent, modulus (e, n)
	- Compute d such that d * e = 1 mod phi(n) (d * e % phi(n) == 1)
	- Private key = (d, n)
	- DESTROY p, q, and phi(n)

	- encrypt --> (plaintext)^e mod n
	- decrypt --> (ciphertext)^d mod n

	- This is all slow because of that exponent being so big as to just not fit into memory nicely.
	
	- WARNING, side channel attack. Take the above with a grain of salt.

## What can you do with asymmetric encryption

1. Key Exchange
2. Authentication
	- Challenge:Response
		- Bob sends pubkey.
		- Alice encrypts a challenge, which is a number and a her pubkey, enrypted by Bob's key.
		- Bob decrypts and encrypts the number using Alice's pubkey.
		- Alice recieves and decrypts the challenge.
